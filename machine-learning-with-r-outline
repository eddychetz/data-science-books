# Here's the outline for practical machine learning with R, with a focus on using tidymodels and creating a simple shiny app:

**Week 1:** Introduction to Machine Learning with R

1. What is machine learning and why is it important?
2. Overview of the machine learning process
3. Installing R and RStudio
4. Introduction to the tidyverse and tidymodels packages
5. Setting up a GitHub account and creating a repository for your project

**Week 2:** Data Preparation and Model Building with tidymodels

1. Data wrangling with dplyr and tidyr
2. Exploratory data analysis with ggplot2
3. Feature engineering and selection
4. Model training and evaluation with tidymodels
5. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
6. Exporting and saving trained models

**Week 3:** Deploying Your Model with a Shiny App

1. Introduction to Shiny and Shinyapps.io
2. Creating a simple Shiny app to deploy your model
3. Adding interactivity with Shiny widgets and reactive expressions
